- Lpsa, or the logarithm of prostate-specific antigen, is a commonly used variable in
predicting prostate cancer outcomes. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland,
and its levels in the blood can provide valuable information about the presence and progression of prostate cancer.
 By predicting the lpsa variable, we can estimate the severity and aggressiveness of prostate cancer,
 which aids in treatment decision-making and patient management.
